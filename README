This project is a test client for a RESTful web service named Neo4JXML .

The service, which is based on NEO4J (a graph-oriented DB), provides the
possibility to create a graph, stored by NEO4J, by creating single nodes and relationships, and the
possibility to query for the paths that connect a given source node to a given destination node in the
graph that has been created. Each node can have properties (i.e. name-value pairs) and labels (i.e.
strings).

The documentation about the available operations provided by the Neo4JXML service is detailed in
the document file neo4jxmlRESTapi.pdf.
